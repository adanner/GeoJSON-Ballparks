GeoJSON-Ballparks
=================

Ballparks of Professional teams in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org).

The goal is to get all professional baseball team ballparks in GeoJSON format.  I'd also like to get independent baseball league teams in the database but they don't always play in the same ballparks year after year.  Internationally the focus is on Asian major professional baseball leagues but Latin American Teams (Columbia, Dominican Republic, etc) and Europe (Italy is left) are goals as well.
